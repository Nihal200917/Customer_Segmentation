This was sourced from a dataset that had basic original mall customer information. The data was filtered and selected to show the relationship between age, gender, Income, and spending score which would possibly become useful for businesses to make the market more effective. The visualizations reveal distinct patterns in age, income, spending behavior, and gender distribution, providing valuable insights for customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies."
